Process mining is widely used to discover, analyze, and improve business processes \cite{van2016data}. Traditional process mining techniques reconstruct how a process is executed by analyzing so-called event logs. These event logs are extracted from IT systems and, therefore, provide insights into how exactly processes are executed in the organization. However, this approach has an important limitation: It limits the scope of process discovery to \textit{back-end events}, i.e., secondary, indirect events that were triggered by the actual user activity. User activities that do not result in such back-end events or take place in productivity applications such as Excel, Outlook, and other desktop applications are, therefore, invisible to existing process mining techniques. Hence, the goal of this proposal is to ...

These examples illustrate that ...  However, to automatically achieve this, X main challenges need to be overcome: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Challenge 1: Transformation}
\item \textit{Challenge 2: Noise filtering}
\item \textit{Challenge 3: Segmentation}
\item \textit{Challenge 4: Event abstraction}
\item \textit{Challenge 5: Labeling}
 
\end{itemize}

An effective technique ... should be able to successfully cope with all these challenges. In the following, we review the state of the art and show that these challenges are not adequately handled up to now.
