\subsubsection{Funding for Staff}
\label{sec:staff}

%We apply for a position of a doctoral researcher (TV-L 13) for the time of 3 years to conduct the work planned for this project (36 PM). The position will be assigned to a PhD student who will work on all work packages. The principal investigator of this project will contribute 6PM to the project, covering the remainder of the overall effort of 42PM. The PhD student will work on the project as central topic of his/her PhD thesis. The PhD student will be supported by the principal investigator as well as researchers we agreed to collaborate with (see Sections \ref{sec:collab:germany} and \ref{sec:collab:abroad}). \\

\subsubsection{Direct Project Costs}
%\begin{funds}[direct project costs]

\subsubsubsection{Equipment up to \euro10,000, Software and Consumables}

%We will not require additional hardware or software. The required infrastructure will be provided by the K\"uhne Logistics University. 

\subsubsubsection{Travel Expenses}
\label{sec:costs:travel}
%The results of the project will be published and presented at national and international conferences. We plan to visit three conferences per year from the second year on. Assuming an average of \euro1500 per conference, we will need 3 x 2 x \euro1500 = \euro9000. We further plan to visit our project partners Prof. Dr. Heiner Stuckenschmidt, Prof. Dr. Han van der Aa, and Prof. Dr. Hajo Reijers. Since Prof. Dr. Heiner Stuckenschmidt and Prof. Dr. Han van der Aa are both working at the University of Mannheim, this means we will conduct two trips, which can be covered by \euro1000 (Mannheim) and \euro1500 (Utrecht) = \euro2500. In total, \euro11500 will be required for covering travel expenses.
