\subsubsection{Funding for Staff}
\label{sec:staff}

We apply for two doctoral researchers (TV-L 13) for the time of 3 years to conduct the work planned for this project (36 PM). Each position will be assigned to a PhD student who will be responsible for one work stream.

\begin{funds}[funding for staff]
\positionmul{Doctoral researcher (WS1 - Van der Aa), TV-L 13, 36 months}{5825}{36}
\positionmul{Doctoral researcher (WS2 - Leopold), TV-L 13, 36 months}{5825}{36}
\end{funds}

\subsubsection{Direct Project Costs}

\subsubsubsection{Equipment up to \euro10,000, Software and Consumables}

We will not require additional hardware or software. The required infrastructure will be provided by the K\"uhne Logistics University and the University of Mannheim.

\subsubsubsection{Travel Expenses}
\label{sec:costs:travel}
The results of the project will be published and presented at national and international conferences. We plan to visit two conferences per year. Assuming an average of \euro1500 per conference, we will need 3 x 2 \euro1500 = \euro9000 per PhD student, i.e. \euro18000 in total. We plan to conduct two joint project meetings per year: one in Hamburg and one in Mannheim. This can be covered by \euro500 per trip, which means we need \euro3000 for project meetings. We further plan to visit each of our national and international project partners once over the course of the project. The trips to the national partners can be covered by \euro500 and the international partners by \euro1000. This sums up to \euro3000 and \euro4000 respectively for the entire project. A summary and the overall total required for traveling expenses are listed below. \\

\begin{funds}[travel expenses]
\positionmul{Conference visits (3 years x 2 visits x 2 researchers)}{1500}{12}
\positionmul{Project meetings (3 years x 2 visits)}{500}{6}
\positionmul{Visit national project partner (3 partners x 1 visit x 2 researchers)}{500}{6}
\positionmul{Visit international project partners (2 partners x 1 visit x 2 researchers)}{1000}{4}
\end{funds}

\subsubsubsection{Visiting Researchers}

As explained in Sections \ref{sec:collab:germany} and \ref{sec:collab:abroad}, we plan to cooperate with several national as well as international researchers. Costs of mutual visits are listed in above in Section \ref{sec:costs:travel}.
