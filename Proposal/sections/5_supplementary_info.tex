 \subsection{Ethical and/or legal aspects of the project}

%We would like to stress two ethical aspects with respect to the use of social media data. First, we will only use fully legal means (e.g, by using the official Twitter API) to obtain social media data. Second, we will replace the user names associated with the extracted posts with identifiers, such that the privacy of the users is protected (even though we will only use public posts). 

\subsection{Data handling}

%As explained in Section \ref{sec:objectives} and \ref{sec:wp6}, we plan to create new data sets consisting of event logs and related Twitter posts. Such data sets are not only relevant for this project, but also for other researchers in the area of process mining. In fact, the large interest in event logs has led to the creation of a central event log repository\footnote{https://www.tf-pm.org/resources/logs}, which is hosted and managed by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining. As a member of the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining, we therefore plan to make our data sets publicly available via this repository.
