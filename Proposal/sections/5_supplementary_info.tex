 \subsection{Ethical and/or legal aspects of the project}
 \label{sec:ethical}
 
Ethical and legal considerations are not applicable to the proposed project since we 
will not conduct experiments on humans, animals, or genetic resources, nor will we  produce results that can be intentionally misused to cause harm. 

We will conduct user studies in WP 6 of the project to evaluate the the effectiveness and efficiency of the discovered process representation. Such user studies are highly common in the context of computer science research. Participation in these studies will be fully voluntarily, participants will have the possibility to opt out at any moment, and we will not collect any personal data as defined by the Ethics Committee of the University of Mannheim\footnote{\url{https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/about/organization/bodies-and-committees/committees-and-councils/ethics-committee}}. Given that we will not collect any personal data, an ethics vote is not required according to the committee's guidelines. 
%\todo{I am not aware of a similar document from KLU that is publicly available. Is that weird? Can we refer to something from the DFG instead? Can we keep it general maybe?}

\subsection{Data handling}

As explained in \autoref{sec:workprogramme}, we may create new synthetic UI log data sets in order to evaluate our approaches. Such data sets are not only relevant for this project, but also for other researchers in the area of process mining. In fact, the large interest in event logs has led to the creation of a central event log repository\footnote{https://www.tf-pm.org/resources/logs}, which is hosted and managed by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining. As a member of the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining, we therefore plan to make our data sets publicly available via this repository.
