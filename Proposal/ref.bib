@article{CHENG2015138,
	abstract = {Process mining techniques are designed to read process logs and extract process models from them. However, real world logs are often noisy and such logs produce bad, spaghetti-like process models. We propose a technique to sanitize noisy logs by first building a classifier on a subset of the log, and applying the classifier rules to remove noisy traces from the log. The improvement in the quality of the resulting process models is evaluated on synthetic logs from benchmark models of increasing complexity on both behavioral and structural recall and precision metrics. The results show that mined models produced from such preprocessed logs are superior on several evaluation metrics. They show better fidelity to the reference models, and are also more compact with fewer elements. A nice feature of the rule based approach is that it generalizes to any noise pattern since the nature of noise varies from one log to another. The rules can also be explained and may be further modified manually. We also give results from experiments with a real dataset.},

@article{SYED2020103162,
	abstract = {Through the application of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) organisations aim to increase their operational efficiency. In RPA, robots, or `bots' for short, represent software agents capable of interacting with software systems by mimicking user actions, thus alleviating the workload of the human workforce. RPA has already seen significant uptake in practice; solution technologies are offered by multiple vendors. Contrasting with this early practical adoption is the hitherto relative lack of attention to RPA in the academic literature. As a consequence, RPA lacks the sound theoretical foundations that allow for objective reasoning around its application and development. This, in turn, hinders initiatives for achieving meaningful advances in the field. This paper presents a structured literature review that identifies a number of contemporary, RPA-related themes and challenges for future research.},
