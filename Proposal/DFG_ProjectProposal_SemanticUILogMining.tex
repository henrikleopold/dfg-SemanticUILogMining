\section{Starting Point}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 - 1.5 pages general intro / positioning / and challenges
\item figure should make clear what we want to achieve
\item Story: Process mining is widely used to discover, analyze, and improve processes. Traditional process mining techniques reconstruct how a process is executed by analyzing so-called event logs. These event logs are extracted from IT systems and, therefore, provide insights into what exactly happened in the organization. A key assumption, however, is that the events in these event logs have a certain level of granularity, i.e. , they relate to activities such as analyzing an order or sending an invoice. If the events relate to very fine-grained actions, such as clicking on a button or entering a name into a text field, traditional process mining techniques are not very helpful... 
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Super cool example}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:example} illustrates this idea. It shows ... 

These examples illustrate that ...  However, to automatically achieve this, X main challenges need to be overcome: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Challenge 1}: 
\item ...
\end{itemize}

An effective technique ... should be able to successfully cope with all these challenges. In the following, we review the state of the art and show that these challenges are not adequately handled up to now.

\subsection{State of the art and preliminary work}

\subsubsection{State of the art}

The problem we address in this proposal relates to three main research streams: 1) process mining, 2) user interaction log mining, and 3) natural language processing in process analysis. Below, we briefly review each stream and highlight which gaps exist with respect to the automated identification of process weaknesses.  

\textbf{Process mining} - ...  \textit{Process discovery} techniques (see e.g. \cite{gunther2007fuzzy,weijters2011flexible,leemans2013discovering}) allow users to investigate a visual representation of a process and, in this way, detect undesired patterns and sources of inefficiency... \textit{Conformance checking} techniques (see e.g. \cite{rozinat2008conformance,adriansyah2011conformance}) provide automated support for detecting deviations from a desired process design. 

% \noindent\fbox{%
%\parbox{0.985\textwidth}{%
%In summary, traditional as well as specialized process mining techniques provide valuable input for process improvement initiatives. They, however, do not automatically identify specific process weaknesses. Existing techniques still rely on the manual work from domain experts. In this project, we will overcome this limitation and automatically identify what process weaknesses exist and to which events they relate. 
%}}

\textbf{User interaction log mining} - ...

%\noindent\fbox{%
%\parbox{0.985\textwidth}{%
%In summary, automated matching techniques have been defined in many contexts including database schemas, ontologies, and process models. The conceptual novelty of the problem we address in this project is to align a non-process-oriented data structure with a process-oriented data structure. A solution for this setting is missing. 
%}}

\textbf{Natural language processing in process analysis} - Many process analysis techniques build on natural language processing (NLP). In general, they can be subdivided into techniques that apply NLP on process models and techniques that apply NLP on process-related text documents. 

%Techniques that apply NLP on \textit{process models} typically analyze the text labels associated with activities, events, and gateways. Such techniques serve a wide range of purposes. Most notably, they facilitate the automated quality assurance of process models. Among others, they can detect and correct the inconsistent use of terminology \cite{koschmider2007user} or 
%violations of labeling conventions \cite{becker2009towards,leopold2013detection}. 
%There are also techniques that aim to improve process model quality by detecting common modeling errors \cite{gruhn2011detecting} or ambiguously labeled activities \cite{pittke2015automatic}. 
%Other purposes of techniques analyzing process model text labels include the identification of re-occurring patterns \cite{la2015detecting} or service candidates \cite{leopold2015_jss} in process model collections. 
%%
%Techniques that apply NLP on \textit{process-related text documents} primarily focus on the automatic elicitation of process models. While many of them focus on eliciting process models from general textual process descriptions \cite{ghose2007process,friedrich2011process,epure2015automatic}, some also extract process models from more specific textual resources such as uses cases \cite{sinha2010use} and group stories \cite{de2009business}. A key challenge addressed by all these techniques is the identification of process-related activities and their ordering constraints. 
%
%For the problem addressed in this proposal particularly the work on process model elicitation is relevant. They provide the conceptual basis for identifying process-related activities in textual resources. However, existing work does not provide the capability to identify sentences that are (or are not) related to the process execution. Since not all sentences of a social media post can be expected to relate to the execution of a process, this is an important capability that needs to be developed. 

% \noindent\fbox{%
%\parbox{0.985\textwidth}{%
%In summary, NLP plays important role in the context of automated process analysis. For this project, particularly the contributions in the area of automated process model elicitation are relevant since they provide they means to identify process-related activities in textual resources. However, they do not provide the capability to detect whether a given sentence relates to the execution of a process or not. Therefore, this capability needs to be developed.

\subsubsection{Preliminary work}

\todo{We obviously need to rewrite this in a smart way. I think we should particularly focus on the complementary aspects. They should not conclude that anyone of us could do this without the other. Highlighting the successful collaboration makes sense obviously.}

Currently, Prof. Leopold is a tenured Associate Professor at the Kühne Logistics University and a senior researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute at the University of Potsdam. He has published over 60 peer-reviewed contributions, among others, in renowned journals such as IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, Information Systems, and Decision Support Systems, as well as at leading international conferences, such as Business Process Management (BPM), Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE), and Computational Linguistics (COLING). These works relate to various aspects of the proposed project, as outlined below in terms of natural language processing in process analysis and process model matching.

%\textbf{Natural language processing in process analysis} - Prof. Leopold has been involved in the development of various techniques that combine natural language processing and process analysis. Among others, he has developed parsers for process model labels \cite{leopold2012refactoring,leopold2019using} that facilitate the automated semantic analysis of process models. Building on these parsers, he further developed techniques for the generation of natural language texts from process models \cite{leopoldsupporting2014} and the automated identification of service candidates from process model repositories \cite{leopold2015_jss}. More recently, Prof. Leopold has been involved in the development of several techniques analyzing textual process descriptions. Among others, he contributed to a technique that can extract process performance indicators from textual process descriptions \cite{van2017transforming} and a technique that can detect to what extent the process behavior described by a textual process description deviates from an event log \cite{vanderaa2018checking}. 

%\textbf{Process model matching} - Prof. Leopold contributed to the development of a variety of process model matching techniques. Among others, he was involved in developing different techniques for matching two process models \cite{leopold2012probabilistic,van2017instance,meilicke2017overcoming}, process models and textual process descriptions \cite{vanderaa2016comparing}, and process models and taxonomies \cite{leopold2015towards}. Besides developing novel process matching techniques, he also contributed to the discourse on process matching evaluation \cite{kuss2018probabilistic}.

In the proposed project, we will build on our prior work in different ways. On the one hand, we will reuse specific techniques, such as the parsing technique from \cite{leopold2019using} for analyzing event labels (see Section \ref{sec:wp2}). On the other hand, we will build on the experiences we gained in related settings. The experience we collected in \cite{van2017transforming} with respect to sentence classification will help us to detect and classify process weaknesses (see Section \ref{sec:wp1}). The experience with distributional semantics in \cite{leopold2015towards} will help us to define effective mechanisms to identify how posts and events are related (see Section \ref{sec:wp2}). Lastly, the experience with respect to matching, and Markov Logic formalizations in particular, will help us to address the problem of aligning a non-process-oriented and a process-oriented data structure (see Section \ref{sec:wp3}).

\section{Objectives and work programme}

\subsection{Anticipated total duration of the project}

The anticipated duration of the project is three years (36 months).

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

The goals of the project are 

\begin{itemize}
\item to develop a technique that can automatically ...   

\item to show the practical value ... 
\end{itemize}

We will approach the \textit{first goal} by defining a novel technique that combines NLP with .... Figure \ref{fig:approach} gives an high-level overview of the proposed architecture. It shows that the proposed technique consists of three main steps.   

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering

\caption{Overview of proposed technique}
\label{fig:approach}
\end{figure}


%The input for the technique is a set of social media posts and a set of event logs\footnote{Note that the technique does not require more than a single event log, but is simply able to handle several event logs.}. 
%The \textit{first step} of the technique is concerned with identifying and extracting weaknesses in the social media posts. This will be achieved by building on NLP tools such as dependency parsers and sentence classification techniques (see work package 1, Section \ref{sec:wp1}). The goal of the \textit{second step} is to identify the links between the identified weaknesses and the events from the event logs. To achieve this, we will  
% characterize the links between all possible weakness-event pairs by using different perspectives of similarity (see work package 2, Section \ref{sec:wp2}). Based on these link characterizations, we will then use optimization rules specified in a Markov Logic formalization to compute the most likely correspondences between weaknesses and events. The rules of the Markov Logic formalization may, for instance, specify that a weakness can only be linked to an event if the timestamp of the associated social media post indicates that the event occurred before the post was created. The definition of appropriate rules will be one of the key tasks of this project (see work package 3, Section \ref{sec:wp3}). The \textit{third step} is concerned with clustering and ranking the weaknesses. The purpose of clustering weaknesses is to recognize whether several weaknesses that are linked to a single event relate to the same \textit{weakness class}. For example, several customers may complain about waiting too long before receiving a voucher. Therefore, we would consider \textit{voucher waiting time} as a weakness class. The purpose of then ranking these weakness classes is to provide an indication of where to start with the improvement initiative. The idea is that highly ranked weakness classes are more frequent and more severe than lower ranked weakness classes. After clustering and ranking, we, therefore, can generate a weakness report that can serve as input for a process improvement initiative (see work package 4, Section \ref{sec:wp4}). 
 
%We will approach the \textit{second goal} of the project by implementing the automated technique defined in work packages 1 through 4. Moreover, we will systematically evaluate the implemented technique by applying it to different real-world data sets. While social media posts are publicly available and can be efficiently obtained via APIs\footnote{See e.g. https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.}, event log data is harder to obtain. However, there are a number of relevant event logs that are publicly available and that we plan to use as a starting point:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{BPI Challenge 2016}: This event log  originates from the International Business Process Intelligence Challenge from the year 2016. It contains events from the Dutch Employee Insurance Agency (UVW), which handles employee insurances and provides labor market-related services in the Netherlands. This log is well-suited for the purposes of this project because it is customer-oriented and contains text data (similar to social media posts) about customer complaints in English.
%\item \textbf{BPI Challenge 2019}: This event log originates from the International Business Process Intelligence Challenge from the year 2019. It contains (English) events from the purchase order handling process of AkzoNobel, a large multinational company with over 50 subsidiaries in the area of coatings and paints. While this log well-suited for the purposes of this project because it is customer-oriented, it does not come with textual resources created by customers. However, we will obtain relevant data from Twitter and, in this way, manually complement the log. 
%\end{itemize} 

%The implementation of the proposed technique will be conducted in Python and based on the PM4Py process mining framework\footnote{https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/} (work package 5, Section \ref{sec:wp5}). By manually creating gold standards for our evaluation data sets, we will test our technique with respect to its extraction, alignment, and clustering capabilities. We will use the evaluation results both during the project for improving our technique and at the end of the project in the context of a summative evaluation (work package 6, Section \ref{sec:wp6}). In the following, we describe the work packages in detail. Note that we provide the estimated duration of each work package in project months (PM) in the title of each work package. 

\subsection{Work programme including proposed research methods}

%We have divided the work into six work packages presented in the subsections below. In the last subsection, we give an overview on the complete project together with a time line that shows the order in which we will work on the different topics.

\subsubsection{Work package 1: Identification of process-related weaknesses in sentences (9PM)}
\label{sec:wp1}


\subsubsection{Work package 2: Definition of similarity metrics (9 PM)}
\label{sec:wp2}


\subsubsection{Work package 3: Modeling the alignment problem (9 PM)}
\label{sec:wp3}

\subsubsection{Work package 4: Grouping and ranking (3 PM)}
\label{sec:wp4}

\subsubsection{Work package 5: Implementation (6 PM)}
\label{sec:wp5}


\subsubsection{Work package 6: Evaluation (6 PM)}
\label{sec:wp6}


\subsubsection{Overview on the work plan}

%As explained above, the project consists of six work packages. Naturally, there are interdependencies among these work packages. Figure \ref{fig:workplan} shows a simplified work plan that mostly abstracts from parallel and overlapping work. The only work package that is shown to be conducted in parallel is work package 5 (i.e., the implementation),  which is spread over a total of 24 months. It is important to highlight that the transitions between two packages won't be as strict as depicted. We are aware of the various interdependencies  (e.g. between work packages 2 and 3) and will take them into account appropriately.  
%%There are, for instance, interdependencies between work package 2 and 3. If the similarity measures are not appropriate, this cannot be compensated by ``smart" modeling. We are fully aware of these interdependencies and will take them into account appropriately. 
%However, the rather abstract view on the work plan shown in Figure \ref{fig:workplan} highlights our general idea of having two main iterations:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The first iteration ends after 21 month. At the end of this iteration, there will be a first implemented prototype available, which we tested in the context of a first comprehensive evaluation. The outcome of this evaluation will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our technique and, therefore, determine which components need to be improved. 
%\item The second iteration is slightly shorter and will be mainly used to address identified weaknesses and improve the performance of the technique. What is more, it contains work package 5, which will be used to group and rank the results from work package 4. Finally, we will perform a summative evaluation and compare our approach to established process mining techniques. 
%\end{itemize}

%\end{figure}
%
%Note that the work plan shown above allocates a total of 42 project months to 3 years. As explained in Section \ref{sec:staff}, we intend to hire a PhD student for 3 years, which means that remaining 6 project months will be covered by the principal investigator of this project.

\subsection{Ethical and/or legal aspects of the project}

%We would like to stress two ethical aspects with respect to the use of social media data. First, we will only use fully legal means (e.g, by using the official Twitter API) to obtain social media data. Second, we will replace the user names associated with the extracted posts with identifiers, such that the privacy of the users is protected (even though we will only use public posts). 

\subsection{Data handling}

%As explained in Section \ref{sec:objectives} and \ref{sec:wp6}, we plan to create new data sets consisting of event logs and related Twitter posts. Such data sets are not only relevant for this project, but also for other researchers in the area of process mining. In fact, the large interest in event logs has led to the creation of a central event log repository\footnote{https://www.tf-pm.org/resources/logs}, which is hosted and managed by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining. As a member of the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining, we therefore plan to make our data sets publicly available via this repository.
